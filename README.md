# Java NumberGuesser, developed by Ryan Brewer
# This program prompts user to guess a number between 1 and 1,000. 
# On each guess, if user's current guess is closer to the number than the last guess, 
# the windows turns red and indicates user is getting warmer.
# If user is getting colder, window turns blue.
